# In the above code snippet, we are making some serious assumptions about
# sockets. The first assumption is that our connection will always succeed,
# and the second is that the server is always expecting us to send data
# first (as opposed to servers that expect to send data to you first and
# await your response). Our third assumption is that the server will always
# send us data back in a timely fashion. We make these assumptions largely
# for simplicityâ€™s sake.
